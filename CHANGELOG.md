# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-11-04 — Contract and schema

- Added `contracts/openapi.yaml`, OpenAPI 3.1 v1 for every module, linted with Redocly CLI.
- Added goose migrations for the whole data model, with `down` sections and database-level idempotency for
  opening a month and for member income items.
- Pinned goose and sqlc through the `go.mod` `tool` directive; added `sqlc.yaml` and the first generated query.
- Added `make migrate`, `migrate-down`, `migrate-status`, `sqlc`, `seed` and `contract-lint`.
- Added `make seed`, an invented dev fixture that is safe to re-run and refuses non-local hosts.
- Added `kernel.Money`: whole COP in `int64`, with parse and format.
- Required a one-time enrollment secret to start MFA enrollment, with its hash and expiry on `users`, so a leaked
  password cannot enroll an authenticator before the owner does.
- Added `users` columns for login lockout and TOTP replay protection.
- Excluded card charges from what closing a month marks `overdue` (D3, D7).
- Deleting a card now deactivates its `card_charge` templates through a trigger; an active one must have a card.
- Capped `billing_months` and `months_covered` at 120, in the schema and the contract.
- Replaced the Makefile's blanket `export`: `TOTP_ENC_KEY` and `PASSWORD_PEPPER` reach only `make dev`, and every
  other value only the targets that use it.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-04 — Foundations

- Added the server skeleton: environment config, JSON logging, `GET /healthz` and graceful shutdown.
- Added the Makefile, local Postgres compose file for Docker or Podman, and `make keys`.
- Added `golangci-lint` config and the CI workflow.
- Added pending test cases for business decisions D1–D11.
